# HTML theme support

The Algolia DocSearch Sphinx extension works best for HTML themes that use dedicated templates to render the search box on every page.

Without customization, this extension makes the DocSearch input look good with these HTML themes:

- [Furo](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/)
- [Read The Docs Sphinx Theme](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Alabaster](https://alabaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

If you use other themes, or to further tweak the styles, you can add custom CSS.

This extension supports themes that use a `searchbox.html` or `sidebar/search.html` template for rendering the search box.
If you're using other themes, you can add [custom templates and custom CSS](/customization.md).
